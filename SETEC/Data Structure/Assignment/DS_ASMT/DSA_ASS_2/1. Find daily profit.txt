1. Find daily profit 
Data-Structure
	Input: int orange_tree = 15, apple_tree = 18, fruit_per_tree = 21;
	       float apple_price = 0.5, orange_price = 0.7;
	Output: float daily_profit;
Algorithm:
	Logic: apple_per_day = apple_tree * fruit_per_tree;
	       orange_per_day = orange_tree * fruit_per_tree;
	       daily_proffit = (apple_pere_day * apple_price) + (orange_per_day * orange_price)
	Control: Direct Calculation	


2. Spending
Data-Structure:
	Input: int lili_money = 50, number_of_book = 4;
	       float book_price = 11.5
	output: float total_spending, money_left;
Algorithm: 
	logic: total_spend = book_price * number_of_book;
	       money_left = lili_money - total_spend;
	Control: Direct Calculation


3. Find the needed money
Data-Structure: 
	Input: int number_of_student = 42, price_per_student = 78, money_have = 500;
	Output: int money_needed;
Algorithm:
	logic: total_spending = number_of_student * price_per_student
	       money_needed = total_spending - money_have;
	Control: Direct Calculation;
